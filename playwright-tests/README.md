# Testing Guide

This project uses [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end testing. Please become familiar with this documentation.

## Writing tests

Tests should be written for each change or addition to the codebase.
If a new feature is introduced, tests should be written to validate its functionality. If a bug is fixed, tests should be written to prevent regression. Writing tests not only safeguards against future breaks by other developers but also accelerates development by minimizing manual coding and browser interactions.

When writing tests, remember to:

- Test user-visible behavior
- Make tests as isolated as possible
- Avoid testing third-party dependencies

> **[LEARN BEST PRACTICES](https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices)**

See the [cookbook](#cookbook) for help in covering scenerios. It is possible to [generate tests](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen) via the [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright).

## Running tests

To run the tests, you may do so through the command line:

```cmd
yarn test
```

Or through VS Code **(recommended)**, see [Getting started - VS Code](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode).

## Recording video

You may automatically record video with your tests by setting

```
use: {
  video: "on"
}
```

in the [playwright.config.js](../playwright.config.js). After running tests, you will find the output as a `.webm` in `./test-results`. Then, [convert to MP4](https://video.online-convert.com/convert/webm-to-mp4) and share.

It is encouraged to include video in pull requests in order to demonstrate functionality and prove thorough testing.

## Cookbook

### Capturing the VM Confirmation Popup

Currently, none of the tests post actual transactions to the smart contracts. Still you should try writing your tests so that they do the actual function call, but just skip the final step of sending the transaction. You can do this by capturing the transaction confirmation popup provided by the NEAR social VM.

```javascript
// click button that triggers transaction
await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Donate" }).nth(1).click();

const transactionObj = JSON.parse(await page.locator("div.modal-body code").innerText());

// do something with transactionObj
expect(transactionObj).toMatchObject({
  amount: 100,
  message: "",
  projectId: DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID,
});
```

See the test called "project with no active pot should donate direct with correct amount" in donate.spec.js for a full example.
